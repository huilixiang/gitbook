## feature engineering
### what problem it solves
How do you get the most out of your data for predictive modeling?
### Importance of Feature Engineering
- Better features means flexibility. even wrong model
- Better features means simpler models.  simple model or parameters less than optimal 
- Better features means better results.
### What is Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data
- Feature Engineering is a Representation Problem.   you have to turn your inputs into things the algorithm can understand
- Feature Engineering is an Art. 
## Sub-Problems of Feature Engineering
### Feature: An attribute useful for your modeling task
### Feature Importance: An estimate of the usefulness of a feature
### Feature Extraction: The automatic construction of new features from raw data
### Feature Selection: From many features to a few that are useful
### Feature Construction: The manual construction of new features from raw data
### Feature Learning: The automatic identification and use of features in raw data
