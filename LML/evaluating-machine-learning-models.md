## machine learning jargon
- deep learning
- the kernel trick
- regularization
- overfitting
- semi-supervised learning
- cross-validation
## outset question
- How can I measure success for this project?
- How would I know when Iâ€™ve succeeded?

## machine learning workflow
- prototype---model selection  
- deployed model
- offline & online evaluation

## why is it so complicated?
### difference between off/online evaluation
- offline  </br>
    >accuracy ; precision-recall
- online <br/>
    >business metrics: LTV
    
### distribution drift
- historical and live data
- assume:  the distribution of data stays the same over time

## evaluation metrics

### offline evaluation mechanisms
